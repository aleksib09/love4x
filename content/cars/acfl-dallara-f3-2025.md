In 2025, FIA Formula 3 will introduce a new car developed by Dallara, replacing the F3 2019 model and set to be used for the next three seasons.

The new car is equipped with a naturally aspirated 3.4-liter six-cylinder Mecachrome engine, producing 380 horsepower at 8,000 rpm.

Its design follows modern trends, resembling the latest F2 and F1 models, ensuring continuity for young drivers progressing through the ranks.

Special attention has been given to cockpit ergonomics to accommodate drivers of different heights and builds.

From a sustainability perspective, the car will run on FIA-certified 100% sustainable fuel, reinforcing the series' commitment to environmental responsibility.

Additionally, the new model will feature 16-inch Pirelli tires made with FSC-certified natural rubber, reducing environmental impact.

This car is designed to enhance racing spectacle by improving overtaking opportunities while also ensuring safety and compliance with modern motorsport standards.
