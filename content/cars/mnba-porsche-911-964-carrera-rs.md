To homologate the new 3.8-litre RSR (the original 964 RS had used a 3.6-litre motor), Porsche needed to offer a road-going version. Fortunately, to convince manufacturers to create new GT racing cars, series organisers had slashed homologation requirements to just a single road-going vehicle.

Although they only technically needed to build one example of the new road-going 911 3.8 Carrera RS, Porsche thought a batch of special order customer cars assembled in the Customer Racing Department at Weissach would bring in some much-needed finance.

Costing roughly double that of the outgoing 3.6-litre Carrera RS, the first example of the expensive new model rolled out of the factory in April 1993.

Compared to its predecessor, the 911 3.8 Carrera RS featured an abundance of performance enhancing modifications. Like the earlier 3.6-litre car, this latest machine was not US-market compliant.

Each 3.8 RS was based on a seam-welded Turbo bodyshell complete with a reinforced floor and beefed up mounting points for the rear suspension, transmission and anti-roll bars.

Like the Turbo S Lightweight, red-painted brake calipers were fitted as standard.

The naturally aspirated M64/04 lump was riddled with an array of special parts, some of which were sourced from prototype engines for the soon-to-be-released 993.

Peak output was now 300bhp at 6500rpm and 266lb-ft at 5250rpm. For comparison, the outgoing 3.6-litre RS pumped out 260bhp at 6100rpm and 240lb-ft at 4800rpm.

At just 1210kg, the 3.8 Carrera RS weighed 80kg less than the Turbo S Lightweight (1290kg) and 40kg less than the standard 3.6-litre Carrera RS (1250kg).

After the first 3.8 Carrera RS emerged in April 1993, another 54 cars followed, the majority of which were produced between September ‘93 and March ‘94.

In addition to these 55 cars (three of which were right-hand drive) Porsche built 49 RSR racing versions.

The RSR went on to become the dominant car in its class recording wins at the Le Mans, Daytona and Spa 24 Hour races, the Sebring 12 Hours and the Suzuka 1000km.
