Grand Prix 2025 brings all F1 2025 cars and drivers from all 10 team in  the FIA Formula 1 2025  Season to Assetto Corsa.

All mod includes Ultra-Detailed 3D Models, new regulations physics, HD sounds, different teams performances and new exciting features. 

{{< notice "tips" >}}This package included with League Edition physics to compete in Online Racing. If you want to revert default Single Player physics,  copy **content** folder from  *_Grand_Prix_2025_Single_Player_physics_backup* folder to /steamapps/common/assettocorsa {{</notice>}}

**MAKE SURE THAT EXTENDED PHYSICS IS TURNED OFF.**
**USE IT FOR RAIN RACES ONLY (ALSO, MAKE SURE THAT THE 2025 RAIN MODE IS ENABLED).**
**OTHERWISE, YOUR CAR HANDLING WILL BE WRONG.**

**Rain Mode**

If you’re planning a rainy race, this mode is for you. It sets the default tires to “Rain” and activates the rear lights so you can see your opponents in the rain.

You can activate this mode in the “Content Manager > MODS > Sim Dream Grand Prix 2025 Rain Mode”.

**Pit Crew Animations**

Each team’s pit crew will appear on the grid and in the pits for a few seconds to enhance immersion.

You can switch it on or off by moving the “PITCREW_Animation_ENABLED/DISABLED” folders in each car directory.

**Individual MFDs**

The Grand Prix 2025 Mod includes different multi-function displays for each team, just like in real life. These displays are supported by both CSP and vanilla game versions.

**Removable HALO**

This time, you can completely remove the HALO in your car’s setup.

You have a unique chance to see how modern F1 cars appear without the HALO system.

**Aero Sensors**

It’s now possible to make the cars look like they do in Pre-Season testing with the aero sensors feature.

You can activate this feature in the car setup.

**Sparks and Tires Visual Damage**

CSP sparks are on another level in the Grand Prix 2025 Mod, exhibiting realistic behavior in the latest CSP versions. No extra setup is needed as they will appear with the default CSP settings.

Ensure you manually copy all folders from the zip archive into your AC folder, following the instructions in the Readme file, when installing the mod.

Do not drag and drop them into the Content Manager. Additionally, enable ‘TyreFX’ in the CSP settings to activate tire visual wear and flat spots.

**Wings, Antennas Movement, and Driver Animations**

All cars’ antennas move when accelerating and cornering, affected by G-forces. Front and rear wings also shake and deform when going through bumps or at high speeds.

The driver’s feet also replicate all the driver’s actions.

**Different Performances for Each Team**

Each team has different performance, just like in real life. Some cars are faster in the corners, while others are faster on the straights.

Additionally, some are easier to handle than others, just like in real life.

**Individual 3D Models and Sounds**

Unlike most mods that use the same 3D model for all the cars, we’ve used different sounds and 3D models for each team, representing their real-life counterparts.

This way, each car appears and feels different.

**4K Skins and Templates**

Each car includes 4K skins for all drivers and a template set, allowing you to create any skin you want.
