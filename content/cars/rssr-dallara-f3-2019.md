The Dallara F3 2019 was an open-wheel racing car developed by Italian manufacturer Dallara for use in the FIA Formula 3 Championship, a feeder series for Formula One. The F3 2019 was the first car used by the FIA Formula 3 Championship and was introduced for the championship's inaugural season and was used until the 2024 season before being replaced by planned Dallara F3 2025 from 2025 season onwards. As the Formula 3 Championship is a spec series, the F3 2019 raced by every team and driver competing in the series.[1][2] The F3 2019 was unveiled at the weekend of the final GP3 Series round in Abu Dhabi in November 2018 and later made its first public appearance when teams contesting the inaugural championship completed a test day at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours in February 2019.[3]

As of 2025, the Dallara F3 2019 remains the longest-serving FIA Formula 3 Championship chassis usage since 2019 through 2024 seasons.
