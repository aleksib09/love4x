The Racing Bulls VCARB 02 is a Formula One car constructed by Racing Bulls that is competing in the 2025 Formula One World Championship. The car is being driven by Yuki Tsunoda and Isack Hadjar, with Liam Lawson (who drove 11 races for the team in 2023 and 2024) later returning to replace Tsunoda from the 2025 Japanese Grand Prix after being demoted from the main Red Bull outfit after the first two rounds of the 2025 season (the Australian Grand Prix and the Chinese Grand Prix). The VCARB 02, which is powered by the Honda RBPTH003 power unit, is the last Racing Bulls car to be powered by Honda RBPT-badged engines; from the 2026 season, Racing Bulls and its sister team Red Bull Racing will utilise Red Bull Powertrains Ford engines.
