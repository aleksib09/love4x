For the [2023 24 Hours of Le Mans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_24_Hours_of_Le_Mans), which marked NASCAR's 75th anniversary and coincided with the race's centenary, the [Garage 56](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garage_56) concept car entry was based on the Camaro ZL1 stock car. [Hendrick Motorsports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports#24_Hours_of_Le_Mans) fielded the modified [NASCAR Cup Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series) [Next Gen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Gen_(NASCAR)#Le_Mans_Garage_56_project) stock car. 7-time Cup Series champion [Jimmie Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmie_Johnson), [2009 Formula One World Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Formula_One_World_Championship) winner and NASCAR driver [Jenson Button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button) and [2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_24_Hours_of_Le_Mans) Le Mans overall and LMP1 winner and WEC veteran [Mike Rockenfeller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rockenfeller) were the drivers, while Johnson's longtime crew chief [Chad Knaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Knaus) was project manager. The car also bore #24 in honor of [Jeff Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Gordon)

During the endurance race, the Garage 56 Camaro exceeded expectations and drew large international fanfare, for its performance and stark visual and aural contrast to the rest of the field.

For the majority of the race, the Garage 56 Camaro was ahead of all the cars in the GTE class. However, after the 20th hour, the vehicle encountered a driveline issue which necessitated over an hour of repairs, after which the team finished in 39th place out of 62 cars, after completing 285 laps.
