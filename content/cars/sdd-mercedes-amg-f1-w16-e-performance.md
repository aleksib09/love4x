The Mercedes-AMG F1 W16 E Performance, commonly known as the Mercedes W16, is a Formula One racing car designed and built by the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team currently competing in the 2025 Formula One World Championship.[1] It is being driven by George Russell, who is in his fourth consecutive season with the team, partnering rookie driver Andrea Kimi Antonelli, who replaces seven-time World Drivers' Champion Lewis Hamilton, who departed for Ferrari following the end of the 2024 season.[2] As such, this is the first Mercedes F1 car since the F1 W03, from the 2012 season, not to be driven by Hamilton.
