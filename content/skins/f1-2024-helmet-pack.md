The wait is now over, F1 2024 helmets are now available!

All 20 helmets are included. Drivers faces have been also integrated in the pack.


**How to install**: copy every file from each driver inside the skin folder that you want.

Note: if there's already an ext_config.ini file in the folder made from the skin's author, don't overwrite it, open it and copy the text inside it (unless the code was from a previous helmet, in that case you can overwrite the file).

**Changelog:**

18/09/2024: added Franco Colapinto's helmet
