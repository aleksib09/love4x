Whilst creating the #32 and #46, I got the idea to make a Pertamax Turbo sponsored entry! This is purely fictional, so I thought I'd make it a dual release alongside the main pack :)

Also included on the design are the fictional drivers G. Nes Papoulis and A. Tsousis, as a nod to their dedication to getting me to make the WRT cars! 

Enjoy :)
