The all new and updated version of ACSPRH is finally available here on Patreon exclusively! Lot of work has been put into this big update in order to bring more realistic helmets according to the new FIA regulations introduced in the 2019 F1 season. The new models were made by DaiMon Design and JA Graphic Designer who gave me permissions to use them! Let me know if you like it and feel free to report any bug/issue you find.

Note: it's NOT possible to see the helmets inside the CM Showroom, please check in game if they're working!
